# ncurses_fun

Just started learning how to work with the ncurses lib. Planning on uploading everything I code as I learn here. :)

Whats been done so far:
1) hello_world: ofc, can't begin learning ncurses without performing the ritual of writing a hello world program.
2) snake_game: the second program i wrote after the hello world program.
